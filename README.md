# EchoMind: AI Content Strategy Agent with Hindsight Memory

**EchoMind makes an AI content strategist remember.** It pairs deterministic analytics (SQLite) with [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/) long-term memory, so recommendations can use a brand's voice, prior decisions, critiques, and evidence-backed beliefs.

> Deterministic math decides **which** editorial pillar is under-served. Hindsight memory decides **how** to win it: the angle, the format, and the brand voice, learned from real feedback.

## Why it matters

Marketing teams constantly reinvent the wheel. EchoMind remembers:
- **What performed:** quantitative metrics per pillar, format, and post.
- **What the brand is:** voice, audience (ICP), and hard guardrails ("never post beginner tutorials").
- **What you decided:** every accept, edit, or reject with critique.
- **What it has learned:** evolving beliefs consolidated from evidence.

The result is a recommendation with an inspectable causal trail ("why this, why now, why this format"). Later accept, edit, or reject decisions are retained in that brand's bank and can change subsequent recommendations.

## The "memory is the star" moment

The app shows the same analysis narrated twice:

| Without memory (stateless) | With Hindsight memory |
| :--- | :--- |
| Generic pick, generic prose | On-brand voice, learned angle |
| No history | Recalls past rejections and critiques |
| Fixed format | **Switches format** when past feedback rejected the default |
| Generic confidence label | **Confidence reflects** current metrics and recalled evidence |

The **Learning** page runs a full cycle in one click (recommend, reject with critique, recommend again) and shows the before/after angle, format, and confidence alongside the recalled feedback that caused the change.

## Key Features

1. **Decision Provenance Matrix:** Every recommendation provides a complete causal audit trail showing every factual metric and recalled memory item (category, evidence, age, influence weight, and decision impact). No black-box outputs.
2. **Responsible AI Guardrail Verification:** Every generated draft is evaluated against active brand rules (voice guidelines, target ICP, taboo rules) and displays an automated pass/fail compliance matrix with reasons.
3. **Exportable Weekly Editorial Calendar:** Converts detected strategic deficits into a balanced 5-day editorial plan exportable directly as **CSV** and **Markdown**.
4. **Honest Uncertainty:** Clearly identifies low-evidence recommendations as *Exploratory* and displays an explicit assumptions callout when historical volume or feedback is sparse.
5. **Belief Conviction Timeline:** Visualizes how the agent's confidence in strategic beliefs strengthens over time as supporting evidence accumulates.
6. **Pillar opportunity map:** Relates allocation gaps to historical engagement so teams can distinguish high-performing under-served topics from saturated ones.
7. **Portfolio impact simulator:** Projects how the proposed weekly calendar changes pillar shares and total distance from target; it is explicitly a planning scenario, not an engagement forecast.
8. **Theme-aware interface:** Streamlit's built-in Light, Dark, and System modes, theme-driven chart colors, neutral surfaces, and responsive page layouts.

## How Hindsight memory is used

EchoMind treats Hindsight as its cognitive layer, not a search index. See `memory/hindsight_adapter.py`.

- **One memory bank per brand** (`ensure_bank`) with a strategist **mission** and **disposition**, keeping recall and retention scoped to that brand.
- **Retain** (`retain_*`): brand rules are stored as **world facts**; every accept, edit, or reject with critique is stored as an **experience** (with structured metadata). Retain is synchronous so the fact is immediately recallable.
- **Recall** (`recall_strategic_context`): three type-scoped recalls (`types=["world"]`, `["experience"]`, `["observation"]`) using Hindsight's multi-strategy retrieval gather guardrails, past feedback, and learned beliefs before every recommendation.
- **Observations become evolving beliefs**: Hindsight automatically consolidates repeated evidence into deduplicated, evidence-grounded **observations**. EchoMind surfaces these as the agent's beliefs, so there is no hand-rolled belief store.
- **Reflect** (`reflect_on_strategy`): powers the **Ask the strategist** page and strategy synthesis, shaped by the bank's mission and disposition.
- **Memory changes the decision, not just the words**: recalled rejections switch the recommended format, and recalled beliefs or critiques set the editorial angle (`agent/orchestrator.py::_memory_plan`).

If Hindsight is unreachable, EchoMind degrades **transparently** to deterministic-only analysis and says that no recalled memory informed the result. It never silently falls back to the mock.

## Quick start

Requires **Python 3.12** and Streamlit 1.40 or newer. Hindsight and LLM keys are optional for local development; without them, use the explicit mock backend and deterministic LLM fallback.

**1. Create a virtual environment and install:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
```bash
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Configure keys** (copy the template, then edit `.env`):

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env      # Windows
```
```bash
cp .env.example .env             # macOS / Linux
```

```ini
HINDSIGHT_API_KEY=your-hindsight-cloud-key

# Option A: Groq (Default)
LLM_PROVIDER=groq
LLM_API_KEY=your-groq-key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b

# Option B: Azure OpenAI
# LLM_PROVIDER=azure
# LLM_API_KEY=your-azure-key
# LLM_BASE_URL=https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/
# LLM_MODEL=<your-deployment-name>
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-06-01
```

For Azure OpenAI, `LLM_BASE_URL` is the Azure resource endpoint and `LLM_MODEL` is the deployed model name. `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` is optional and defaults to `2024-06-01`.

`.env` is auto-loaded at startup and is gitignored.

**3. Seed the demo database** (two brands):

```bash
python -m database.seed
```

**4. Run:**

```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

**Offline mode:** in PowerShell set `$env:HINDSIGHT_USE_MOCK="true"` and leave `$env:LLM_API_KEY` empty. The in-memory mock persists only for the current Streamlit session; deterministic narratives need no network access.

---

## Demo flow (75 seconds)

See [docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) for the 75-second reviewer script and preparation steps.

---

## Testing

```powershell
$env:HINDSIGHT_USE_MOCK="true"
pytest
```

The suite covers the memory loop, adapters, deterministic guardrails and calendar exports, confidence/provenance, and every Streamlit page through `AppTest`. The live-server integration test skips when no Hindsight service is reachable.
